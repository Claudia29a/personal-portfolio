# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with Angular and styled using Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, experience, and contact information.

## Features

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Custom color palette and fonts (Abhaya Libre)
- Modular Angular components for pages and features
- Smooth navigation and interactive UI elements

## Technologies Used

- Angular (latest stable version)
- Tailwind CSS v3 for utility-first styling
- TypeScript for application logic
- HTML5 and CSS3

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Angular CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-portfolio.git

2. Install dependencies

3. Run the development server
ng serve --open

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Customization

### Colors

Custom colors have been added in `tailwind.config.js` and can be used as utility classes like `bg-customDarkBrown`, `text-customOrange`, etc.

### Fonts

Using the Abhaya Libre font family. Use `font-abhaya` with `font-normal` or `font-medium` for regular and medium weights.
